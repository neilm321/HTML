<h1>The Statue of Liberty</h1>
  <p> The Statue of Liberty was built over nine years 
    <br>by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi. 
    <br>Upon its completion in 1884 all 350 individual pieces of the statue were packed into 214 crates for the long boat ride from france to New York.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>The Statue arrived in America several months later
    <br>and was reconstructed on Liberty Island.
    <br>Auguste Bartholdi thought that the New York harbor was the perfect setting for his masterpiece because it was where immigrants got their first view of the New World.;</p>
